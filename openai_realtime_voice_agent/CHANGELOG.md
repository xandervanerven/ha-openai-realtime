# Changelog

All notable changes to this add-on. Newest first.

## 0.4.31 (dev channel)

- **Fixed: an answer could cut off mid-sentence and the assistant then went
  deaf.** When your sentence was split into two turns (a pause at the wrong
  moment), OpenAI rejected the second answer attempt and the session's reader
  stopped — killing the answer that was playing and ignoring everything after
  it. Such harmless protocol races are now ignored and the playing answer
  simply continues.

## 0.4.30 (dev channel)

- The four "custom" text fields (model / voice / search model / transcript
  model) no longer clutter the page: they stay hidden until you need them
  (pick "custom" in the dropdown, then enable "Show unused optional
  configuration options" at the bottom).
- The system-prompt field now explains how to edit it comfortably: the ⋮ menu
  → "Edit in YAML" gives a full text editor (the add-on UI itself only
  supports single-line fields).

## 0.4.29 (dev channel)

- **Cleaner Configuration tab.** Options are now grouped and ordered (Basics →
  Model & voice → Conversation → Web search → Audio → Home Assistant →
  Advanced → Debug) and every description is rewritten in plain, practical
  language. A full Dutch translation is included (shown automatically when
  your HA is set to Dutch).
- Confusing or broken switches were removed (they are now fixed at their only
  sane value); the legacy server_vad fields moved to Advanced and stay hidden
  until you enable "Show unused optional configuration options".
- Friendlier defaults for new installs: follow-up mic delay 200 ms and
  playback buffer 150 ms (existing installs keep their own values).

## 0.4.28 (dev channel)

- **"Stop" during the after-reply listening window now actually stops.** The
  open mic had already streamed the word to OpenAI, which answered it as a
  question. The bridge now treats the device's stop as authoritative: it
  discards the in-flight audio and instantly cancels any answer OpenAI
  started for it. (Pair with the dev firmware update, which also makes the
  local "stop" detection more sensitive.)

## 0.4.27 (dev channel)

- **Dev diagnostics:** new `log_level` option (the dev add-on defaults to
  `DEBUG`). At DEBUG the add-on logs the full turn / audio / interruption
  lifecycle (`🎚️` markers), the OpenAI session age at a drop + the reconnect gap
  duration, and surfaces the `websockets` connection events. Stable stays at INFO.
  Helps diagnose connection blips, stop-word timing, and stale-audio-after-stop.

## 0.4.26

- **Web search is now ON by default**, using **gpt-5.5** (the best-quality search
  model), so the assistant can look things up online — weather, news, facts — out
  of the box. **Existing installs keep their saved setting**: if you had it off,
  switch `enable_web_search` on (and set `web_search_model` to `gpt-5.5`) in the
  add-on Configuration. The cheaper mini/nano models stay available.

## 0.4.25

- **Fix:** the first thing you said in the few seconds right after an automatic
  reconnect (e.g. after the 60-minute session cap) could be ignored
  (`conversation_already_has_active_response`). The reconnected session no longer
  creates a duplicate response, so that turn answers normally.

## 0.4.24

- **Renamed** to **OpenAI Realtime 2 Voice Agent**.
- Rewrote the store/info description and added a full **Documentation** tab
  (install steps, OpenAI key, Home Assistant MCP setup, recommended settings, web
  search, credits). Removed stale text from the original upstream client.
- Default system prompt is now an English, voice-tuned prompt (silent tool calls,
  varied confirmations, language pinning). Your own saved prompt is not changed.
- Default `follow_up_open_delay_ms` and `playback_prebuffer_ms` set to `0` (raise
  them if the device hears its own tail or you hear crackle).

## 0.4.23

- **Fix:** the 60-minute session cap sometimes left the session dead until a
  restart. It now reconnects automatically in all cases (both the keepalive-drop
  and the `session_expired` forms).

## 0.4.22

- **New options:** voice **speed** (0.25–1.5), **max reply length**
  (`max_output_tokens`), and **input noise reduction** (off / near-field /
  far-field). All default to current behaviour.

## 0.4.21

- Model, voice, web-search-model and transcription-model options are now
  **dropdowns** with the known-good values, each with a **custom** entry if you
  need a value not in the list.

## 0.4.20

- **New:** optional **web search**. Turn on `enable_web_search` to let the
  assistant look things up online (weather, news, facts). Uses your OpenAI key;
  off by default. Model configurable via `web_search_model` (default gpt-5.4-mini).

## 0.4.19

- Clarified the MCP option help text for both the built-in HA MCP Server and the
  unofficial ha-mcp add-on.

## 0.4.18

- **Fix:** removed a meaningless filler reply ("I'm ready to continue…") that could
  appear on the first turn of a session.

## 0.4.17

- **Fix:** cap restored conversation history (`max_context_messages`, default 12) to
  bound per-turn token cost and avoid hitting OpenAI's rate limit.

## 0.4.16

- **Fix:** the device no longer gets stuck blinking "thinking" after a turn-ending
  error (e.g. a rate limit) — it returns to idle so you can retry.

## 0.4.14

- **New:** `playback_prebuffer_ms` jitter buffer to reduce occasional crackle at the
  start of replies.

## 0.4.12 – 0.4.13

- **Fix:** "say stop, then immediately ask again → silence". Disabled the broken
  server-side audio truncation that wedged the next turn.

## 0.4.9 – 0.4.11

- **New:** auto-reconnect the OpenAI Realtime session when its connection drops
  (keepalive timeout / 60-minute cap), instead of going dead until a restart.
  Refined so a normal device disconnect doesn't trigger an unnecessary reconnect.

## 0.4.6 – 0.4.8

- **New:** configurable post-reply **follow-up listening window** (answer back
  without re-saying the wake word) + its open-delay, and per-option help text in the
  UI.
- **New:** the assistant's and user's transcripts are logged to the add-on log
  (`🤖 assistant:` / `🗣️ user:`).

## 0.4.0 – 0.4.4

- **Fix:** resample the device's 16 kHz mic to the 24 kHz OpenAI requires (garbled
  speech), and drop empty audio chunks.
- **New:** device **"stop"** interrupt now actually cancels the reply and clears
  buffered audio.

## 0.3.x

- Switched the target to **gpt-realtime-2**, pinned pipecat-ai 0.0.97, and tuned
  turn detection (semantic VAD), phase delivery to the device, and the startup
  sequence to stop double-responses. Made the disconnect tool and transcription
  model configurable.

## Earlier

- Initial pipecat + WebSocket implementation (forked from
  [fjfricke/ha-openai-realtime](https://github.com/fjfricke/ha-openai-realtime)).
