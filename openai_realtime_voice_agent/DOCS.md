# OpenAI Realtime 2 Voice Agent — Documentation

This add-on runs an **OpenAI `gpt-realtime-2`** voice session and bridges it to Home
Assistant control and web search. It is the backend half of a two-part project; the
front half is custom **firmware for the Home Assistant Voice PE** device (see
[Firmware](#firmware-home-assistant-voice-pe-only) below).

```

---

## 1. Install the add-on

1. In Home Assistant go to **Settings → Add-ons → Add-on Store**.
2. Top-right **⋮ → Repositories**, add:
   `https://github.com/xandervanerven/ha-openai-realtime`
3. Find **OpenAI Realtime 2 Voice Agent** in the store and click **Install**.
   (There is no prebuilt image — Home Assistant builds it locally the first time,
   which takes a few minutes.)
4. Open the add-on's **Configuration** tab to set it up (next sections).

## 2. Get an OpenAI API key

1. Go to <https://platform.openai.com/> → **API keys** → **Create new secret key**.
2. Make sure **billing** is set up on your OpenAI account — `gpt-realtime-2` (audio)
   and web search are paid usage.
3. Paste the key into the add-on's **`openai_api_key`** option.

> **Heads-up on rate limits:** new accounts start at a low tokens-per-minute (TPM)
> tier. `gpt-realtime-2` audio is token-heavy, so if you see *"Rate limit reached"*
> in the logs, raise your usage tier in the OpenAI dashboard, or keep
> `max_context_messages` modest (default 12).

## 3. Let it control Home Assistant (MCP)

The assistant controls your home through Home Assistant's **official MCP Server**.

1. In HA: **Settings → Devices & Services → Add Integration → "Model Context
   Protocol Server"** and add it.
2. **Expose the entities** you want voice control over to **Assist**
   (Settings → Voice assistants → *Exposed entities*). The MCP server only offers
   what's exposed.
3. In the add-on, leave **`ha_mcp_url`** **blank** — it then uses the built-in
   endpoint (`http://supervisor/core/api/mcp`) with the add-on's own token. Leave
   **`longlived_token`** blank too, unless startup logs a 401/403 on
   `/core/api/mcp` (then paste a HA long-lived token there).

You get a small fixed set of Assist tools (`HassTurnOn`, `HassTurnOff`,
`HassLightSet`, `GetLiveContext`, `GetDateTime`, …). **`GetLiveContext`** is the
"what's the current state?" tool — keep it; it's what answers *"is the light on?"*.

**`mcp_tool_allowlist`** (optional): a comma-separated whitelist of tool names. Leave
blank to expose all, or trim to just what you use, e.g.:
`HassTurnOn,HassTurnOff,HassLightSet,GetLiveContext,GetDateTime`

## 4. Recommended starting settings

**The defaults are the recommended settings** — for a first run you only need the
API key, the MCP integration (section 3), and ideally your language. The
Configuration tab is grouped: **🔑 Basics → 🗣️ Model & voice → 💬 Conversation →
🌐 Web search → 🎚️ Audio → 🏠 Home Assistant → ⚙️ Advanced → 🔍 Debug**, and every
option has plain-language inline help.

| Option | Default | Note |
|---|---|---|
| `openai_model` | `gpt-realtime-2` | newest speech-to-speech model |
| `openai_voice` | `marin` | `marin`/`cedar` are the newest voices |
| `transcription_language` | *(blank)* | set your ISO code (e.g. `nl`): locks the language + logs the user transcript |
| `instructions` | *(English default)* | the system prompt; swap the LANGUAGE line for your language |
| `follow_up_listen_seconds` | `8` | mic stays open this long so you can answer back |
| `follow_up_open_delay_ms` | `200` | echo guard before the follow-up mic opens; 0 = snappiest |
| `vad_eagerness` | `low` | waits longest before deciding you're done talking |
| `playback_prebuffer_ms` | `150` | raise to ~250 if you hear crackle; 0 = play immediately |
| `max_context_messages` | `12` | bounds per-turn token cost |
| `enable_web_search` | `true` | online lookups; set `false` to disable |
| `web_search_model` | `gpt-5.5` | best-quality search model; mini/nano are cheaper |

The legacy `server_vad` turn-detection fields live at the bottom of ⚙️ Advanced and
only appear when you enable **"Show unused optional configuration options"** —
leave them unset unless you have a specific reason.

## 5. Web search

When **`enable_web_search`** is on (**the default**), the assistant gets a `web_search` tool. When
it needs current or general info (weather, news, facts), it calls that tool; the
add-on then makes a **second, server-side OpenAI call** (the Responses API
`web_search` built-in tool, on **`web_search_model`**) and reads a short spoken
answer back.

- Uses your **existing OpenAI key** — no extra account.
- Default model `gpt-5.5` (best quality). Cheaper options trade price/quality
  (`gpt-5.4`, `gpt-5-mini`, the nano models, …) — a few cents per search.
- Adds ~1–3 s while it searches (the device shows "thinking").
- If the model name is rejected, the assistant just says it couldn't search — it
  won't crash the session, so you can change `web_search_model` and retry.

## 6. Options reference & tuning

Every option has a description on the **Configuration** tab. The ones worth knowing:

- **Model / voice / transcription model** are dropdowns with a **`custom`** entry +
  a `*_custom` text field if you want a value not in the list.
- **`transcription_language`** turns the side-channel transcript on. With it set you
  get `🗣️ user: …` lines in the add-on log (handy for debugging); it does **not**
  change what the model understands — the main model hears your audio natively.
- **`follow_up_open_delay_ms` / `playback_prebuffer_ms`** default to `200` / `150`
  — a small echo guard and jitter cushion. Set them to `0` for the snappiest
  feel; raise them if the device "answers nobody" after a reply (open delay) or
  you hear crackle at the start of replies (prebuffer).

## 7. Reading the logs

The add-on log shows each turn: `🗣️ user:` (when transcription language is set),
`🤖 assistant:` (the reply text), `📞 phase ->` (device state), tool calls, and
`🔌 …reconnecting` / `✅ reconnected` on a connection recovery. View it on the add-on
**Log** tab.

## Firmware (Home Assistant Voice PE only)

This add-on expects the custom **Voice PE firmware** that turns the device into a
thin client (it streams mic audio here and plays the reply). That firmware:

- is **specific to the Home Assistant Voice PE** hardware (ESP32-S3 + XMOS), and
- lives in its own **public** repository:
  **[xandervanerven/home-assistant-voice-pe](https://github.com/xandervanerven/home-assistant-voice-pe)**.

You flash it once via a tiny per-device "stub" in ESPHome Builder; after that, firmware
updates are **one click** — no tokens, no copy-pasting. That repo has the full
from-scratch guide (flashing + adopting the device in ESPHome Builder).
