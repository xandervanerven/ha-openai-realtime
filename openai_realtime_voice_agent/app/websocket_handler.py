    pipecat 0.0.97's OpenAIRealtimeLLMService has NO reconnect logic: when the
    OpenAI WS drops (1011 keepalive ping timeout, 1001 going away on the 60-min
    cap, 1006, or any send/receive failure) it treats the send error as fatal and
    floods ErrorFrame — ~15/s, one per forwarded mic frame — forever. The single
    persistent session is then dead until the add-on restarts, so the device gets
    no answer to any further turn (observed live: a 1011 flood after which the
    next question got silence).

    This processor watches the ErrorFrames as they travel upstream to the task
    source, and on the first connection-death signature it:
      1. emits `idle` to the device so it unsticks (LED + mic reset), and
      2. calls service.reset_conversation() — the one PUBLIC method that does
         _disconnect() + _connect() + re-sends the session config (instructions,
         tools, turn detection) — to bring the session back IN PLACE. No pipeline
         rebuild: the running pipeline keeps the same service object, which is
         exactly the one reset_conversation reconnects.

        # active (avoids the noisy response_cancel_not_active in the common
        # already-burst-finished case).
        #
        # We deliberately do NOT queue an InterruptionTaskFrame anymore. It made
        # pipecat run _handle_interruption → _truncate_current_audio_response(),
        # which tells OpenAI to truncate the assistant audio at the *playback*
        # position. But OpenAI bursts the reply faster than real-time, so that
        # position overshoots the audio that actually exists and OpenAI rejects
        # the truncate with invalid_request_error ("Audio content of N ms is
        # already shorter than M ms"). That error left the realtime session in a
        # broken state where the user's VERY NEXT turn got NO response — the
        # recurring "say stop, then immediately ask again → silence" bug. Since
        # the device already silenced playback, dropping the truncate costs us
        # nothing and keeps the next turn alive. (The backend still drains its
        # already-buffered output to the device, which the device discards —
        # minor wasted bandwidth, tracked as roadmap #3; no extra tokens because
        # response.cancel stops further generation.)
        # FOLLOW-UP-WINDOW STOP (the "stop heard as a question" bug). During the
        # post-reply follow-up window the device mic is OPEN and streaming, so by
        # the time the device's local wake-word detects "stop" and sends us the
        # interrupt, the stop word's audio is ALREADY in OpenAI's input buffer.
        # Left alone, the server VAD commits it as a user turn and — with
        # create_response=true — the model literally ANSWERS the word "stop"
        # ("Ik hou me stil…"). The device's local detection must therefore be
        # authoritative on the cloud side too, in two layers:
        #   1) input_audio_buffer.clear discards the not-yet-committed stop-word
        #      audio (the device closed its own mic gate in the same instant),
        #      so in the common case no turn is created at all;
        #   2) if the server VAD committed BEFORE our clear landed (tight race),
        #      OpenAI creates a response moments later anyway — so any assistant
        #      conversation item that appears within INTERRUPT_KILL_WINDOW_S of
        #      a device interrupt is cancelled on arrival (handler below). A
        #      legitimate next turn cannot fall inside that window: after a stop
        #      the mic is closed, and a fresh wake-word turn needs the chime +
